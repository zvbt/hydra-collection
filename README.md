# Hydra Collection

Simple NodeJS web server to generate & host [Hydra launcher](https://github.com/hydralauncher/hydra) download sources

## Usage

The json generator is located here https://hydra.zvbt.space/ (You need to import it manually in the [hydra.json](/hydra.json) file.)

Import `https://hydra.zvbt.space/collection` to your download sources in the settings

Now if you go to download options you should see my Hydra collection

This is just an example. I probably will not keep this list updated.
